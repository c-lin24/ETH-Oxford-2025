# Crypto Twitter Debate Analyzer -  ETH Oxford 2025
We have built an analysis tool that locates debates between influential Crypto Twitter accounts, generates summaries, detects underlying real-world events that may have triggered/influenced the debate.

## Project requirements:
 - Use the provided API to fetch and analyze Twitter data to identify conflicts/debates in the crypto space (contact us on Discord for API access if you want to do this challenge, or come to our booth in the 
mezzanine)
 - Measuring issue importance, influence of involved accounts, and stance of participants
 - Generate detailed summaries of the debate and the opposing viewpoints
 - It should run on Linux and WSL, you can use docker to make it easy to deploy
 - Clear documentation of the analysis methodology and scoring algorithms, and a video demonstration of the system in action
